#### User Cache
(see [problem description](https://github.com/garryya/ucache/blob/master/TASK_DESCRIPTION.txt) for the details)

* the user cache implemented as doubly linked list with size limited to L
* add/find worst case complexity is O(L), which is close to O(1) if L << N (N - number of users) 
* please use **ucache-test.py** for testing and usage example

```
ucache-test.py 3
```

**TODO**
